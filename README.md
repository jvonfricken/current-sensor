# Current Sensor

This is a project that utilizes an ESP32 + a PECMAC125A current sensor to provide an MQTT publisher wirelessly.

This uses PlatformIO as the build toolchain for the device. But, it's also using Arduino Wrapper around ESP-IDF.

This project also utilizes FreeRTOS for the async work.
